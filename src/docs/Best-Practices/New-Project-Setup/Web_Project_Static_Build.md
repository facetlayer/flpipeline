# Next.js Static Build

This project uses a static-file "export" build.

The project does NOT run Next.js as an API server. Don't write any endpoints to /api/.
Any required APIs will need to be implemented in a separate server. If the project
does not have an API server yet, then don't create one unless specifically directed.
