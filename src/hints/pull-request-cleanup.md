# How to review an outgoing PR #

Look at the code diff in the current branch compared to the 'main' branch.
Examine and understand the changes. Browse the project's source files to
understand the effect and context of each change.

Review all the outgoing changes for problems and code quality. These changes
will soon be submitted as a pull request. Improve the code quality as
much as possible.

Look for:

 - Areas that need better type declarations
 - Leftover console.log() statements
 - Other issues

 Present a plan that lists high priority and low priority issues and ask
 the user for next steps.
